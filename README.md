Overview:
Gain hands on experience using practical cybersecurity tools. The operating system I will be using is proxmox, 
where I will be able to create dedicated virtual machines (VM’s) and work on server management. 
I will be creating a contained network using a pfsense firewall using an .iso on a dedicated VM. 
I will create a segmented network using multiple virtual local area networks (VLAN’s) in which each VM could reside on a separate network. 

Operating Systems (OS) and security tools being used: 

  •	Kali Linux: A Debian-based Linux distribution designed for penetration testing and security auditing. This will be our main machine
